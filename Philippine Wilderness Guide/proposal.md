Philippine Wilderness Guide

To help campers/explorers to have a safe journey in our known forests or in the wild here in the philippines 

Statement of the Problem

A lot of people usually plan to camp out in a forest or go Mountain climbing without proper knowledge of the Vicinity of the selected wildlife area just to have fun or just to have experience. They don't know what animals could be lurking around or what plants might help them or what plant might poison them and that would be a problem if they want to be safe.


Proposed Solution

1. To help identify what Animals you might encounter in the wild, we will have a list of animals that can be found in The said wildlife area.
2. We will have a feature where you will take a picture of a plant, mushroom, or herbs to identify whether they are edible, poisonous, or hebs.
3. Lists of Known Forests in the Philippines and it's location.
